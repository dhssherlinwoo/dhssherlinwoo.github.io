  <p> This is currently my favourite movie! It is called Jumanji Welcome To The Jungle. I really love the movie as it is really funny 
   and engaging and it pulls me into the story as well. This amazing story is abot 4 friends being stuck in the jungle after playing the game Jumanji and it talks about their adventure 
   in a real life game and how they work together to find their way out. </P>
